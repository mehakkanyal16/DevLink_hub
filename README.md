# DevLink Hub - Learning React Router DOM

## 📌 Overview
DevLink Hub is a project where I explored and implemented **React Router DOM**, gaining hands-on experience with client-side routing in React applications. This project helped me understand how routing works in React, allowing for smooth navigation between different components without reloading the page.

## 🚀 What I Learned  

### 1️⃣ Setting Up React Router  
- Installed `react-router-dom` to enable routing capabilities.  
- Wrapped the application inside `<BrowserRouter>` to allow navigation between pages.  
- Created different routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components.  

### 2️⃣ Defining Routes  
- Used `<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />` to define paths and render specific components.  
- Implemented **nested routes** for better structuring.  

### 3️⃣ Navigation Using Link & NavLink  
- Used `<Link to='/about'>About</Link>` to navigate between pages without reloading.  
- Learned the difference between `<Link>` and `<NavLink>`, where **NavLink** provides an active class for styling the active page.  

### 4️⃣ Dynamic Routing & URL Parameters  
- Implemented **dynamic routes** like `/user/:id` to fetch data based on URL parameters.  
- Used `useParams()` to extract parameters from the URL.  

### 5️⃣ Programmatic Navigation  
- Utilized `useNavigate()` for handling redirections based on user actions.  
- Example: `navigate('/dashboard')` to redirect after a successful login.
